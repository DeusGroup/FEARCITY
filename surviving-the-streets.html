            <p class="lead">Twenty years riding Queens taught me the rules. This isn't some guide for tourists - this is real talk from someone who's earned every mile.</p>

            <h2>Know Your Territory</h2>
            <p>Every neighborhood in Queens has its own rules. Astoria isn't Jamaica. LIC isn't Far Rockaway. You need to read the streets like a map, and every block tells a different story.</p>

            <p>Learned this the hard way in '03. Rolled through Corona like I owned the place, engine roaring, making noise. Old-timer named Julio pulled me aside outside his garage. "Kid," he said, "you ride like that around here, you won't last long. Show respect, get respect."</p>

            <p>He was right. The streets don't care about your ego. They only respect authenticity.</p>

            <h2>Build Your Rep Slow</h2>
            <p>Nobody trusts a flashy newcomer. In Queens, your reputation is everything, and it takes years to build. Start small. Help out at local shops. Show up to rides. Don't be the loudest guy in the room - be the most reliable.</p>

            <p>My first year, I spent more time with a wrench than on my bike. Carlos at the shop on Northern Boulevard let me hang around, sweep floors, learn the trade. Wasn't glamorous, but every rider in the area started knowing my face.</p>

            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respect the veterans</strong> - They survived longer for a reason</li>
                <li><strong>Never ride alone at night</strong> - Especially in unfamiliar territory</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your bike clean</strong> - Shows respect for the culture</li>
                <li><strong>Help when you can</strong> - Community comes first</li>
                <li><strong>Don't start problems</strong> - But be ready to finish them</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Find Your Crew</h2>
            <p>Riding solo has its place, but in Queens, having solid people around you isn't just nice - it's survival. Your crew becomes your family, the people who'll ride through hell for you.</p>

            <p>But choose carefully. A bad crew can drag you down faster than anything. Look for riders who respect the culture, who've been around, who understand that being part of something bigger means responsibility.</p>

            <h2>Gear That Matters</h2>
            <p>Your gear tells your story before you say a word. Every patch, every scar on your jacket, every mod on your bike speaks to who you are. Don't fake it - earn every mark.</p>

            <p>Buy quality. Cheap gear won't protect you when it counts, and everyone can spot a fake from miles away. Get the real stuff and take care of it like your life depends on it - because it does.</p>

            <h2>The Long Game</h2>
            <p>Twenty years in, I'm still learning. The streets keep changing, new riders keep coming up. But some things stay constant: respect, authenticity, and understanding that this lifestyle is bigger than any one person.</p>

            <p>Queens motorcycle culture has been here since the 70s and it'll be here long after we're gone. Your job is to add to the legend, not take away from it. Ride with purpose. Build something lasting.</p>

            <p><strong>That's what survival really means - not just making it through today, but building something worth passing down.</strong></p>
